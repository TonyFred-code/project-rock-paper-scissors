# Project: Rock Paper Scissors (THE ODIN PROJECT)

## Overview

### The challenge

I took on the challenge to create a simple implementation of the hand-game "Rock Paper Scissors".
The key tasks included:

- Making a UI for users to play the game
- Declaring a winner when a user or computer scores 5 points
- Adding the ability to end the game

## My process

I tackled this project step by step:

- Started without a UI, as the first project iteration required
- Added a UI and refactored working logic over 4 days
- Experienced a few hiccups, but progress was made
- Utilized flexbox extensively for the UI layout, learning more than expected

### Built with

- Flexbox (extensively)

## Continued Development

My plans for ongoing development include:

- Learning more layout techniques to master the challenge from Frontend Mentor
- Improving code efficiency by reducing unnecessary functions and repeated logic
