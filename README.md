## My process
    - Started with no UI as first project iteration required
    - Gave a UI and refactored working logic over a period of 4 days
    - Have a couple of tinks to get around but its getting there
    - Used flexbox heavily for the UI layout (learnt more than i expected)

### Built with
    - Flexbox (extensively)

## Continued Development
    - Learn more layout techniques to properly solve the challenge from frontend Mentor
    - Need to better reduce unnecessary functions and repeated code logic
